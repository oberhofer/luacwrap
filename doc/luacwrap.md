# Introduction

LuaCwrap is a wrapper for C datatypes written in pure C. It utilizes metadata (aka type descriptors)
to describe the layout and names of structures, unions, arrays and buffers.

## Features

LuaCwrap

 * supports struct and union types
 * supports array types
 * supports fixed length buffers
 * supports pointers
 * lua strings and userdata could be assigned to pointer attributes
 * maintains lifetime of lua objects which had been assigned to pointer attributes
 * support for reference attributes (manual control lifetime of assigned lua object)
 * supports customizeable method table for struct and union types
 * supports C and Lua API

# Prerequisites

Depends on Lua, the Lua development packages. LuaRocks is used for build/install.

## Linux

Install the following packages

    sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0 liblua5.1-0-dev

## Windows

For a beginner I would recommend to install the latest "Lua for Windows" 
setup from from http://luaforwindows.googlecode.com/ and install 
LuaCWrap via LuaRocks.

# Installation via Luarocks

Install on console via 

    luarocks install luacwrap

# Usage

## Boxed/Embedded objects

LuaCwrap deals with two types of objects:

  * Boxed objects
  * Embedded objects

The lifetime of both object types are controlled by the Lua VM. Boxed objects are 'toplevel'
whereas Embedded objects reference 'embedded' objects within so called 'outer' objects. Because of that Embedded 
objects have to control the lifetime of their outmost boxed object.

### Pointer attributes

If a boxed object contains a pointer attribute ($ptr) you are able to assign different 
Lua object types to the pointer attribute. These objects types like strings, userdata and light userdata 
include LuaCwrap objects which makes it possible to create pointer connected data structures.
To couple the lifetime of Lua objects that had been assigned to a pointer attribute to the lifetime of 
the outer object a reference to the Lua object pointed to is stored within the environment table
of the outer object.
To handle union types correctly the pointer attribute offset is used as the table key. The table value
contains the referenced value.

### Reference attributes

Sometimes it is necessary to manually control the lifetime of Lua objects pointed to by
pointer attributes. For this reference attributes ($ref) are used. If you assign Lua objects to 
reference attributes a reference to the Lua object is stored in a hidden reference table under a unique
integer id. The integer id is assigned to the reference attribute. On reading a reference attribute the
integer id is returned as a reference object. This reference object can be used to access the underlying 
Lua object (via `refobject.value`) the reference index number (via `refobject.ref`) or to release the 
reference manually (via `refobject:release()`). 

### Light embedded objects

</pre>

Embedded objects can also be used to push C pointers during calls from C to Lua. But in this case you 
have to be aware that in most cases the C pointer isn't valid after the Lua function scope ends. 
If you want to store the referenced value you have to duplicate the underlying instance via 
<object>:__dup(), which creates a new boxed object.

    function callback_from_C(myobject)
      mystorage[#mystorage+1] = myobject:__dup()
    end

<div class="attention">
Another issue of C controlled objects is that they have no associated Lua environment table. 
If you set pointer attributes to your own Lua objects, you have to take care that they don't 
go out of scope. Otherwise the C function returned to after the assignment could try to access 
memory that has already been garbage collected. A good advice is to use light embedded objects 
only when they do not contain pointer attributes.
</div>

## Dual interface

The LuaCwrap exports several functions. One of them, the `luaopen_luacwrap`
function, enables that LuaCwrap could be used from standalone Lua scripts.
The other functions could be bound to by C modules or executables
to be able to register object descriptors or to create/push object instances
on the Lua stack.

## Lua-API

### Import LuaCwrap

Importing LuaCwrap is only necessary if you want to declare your own types via the Lua-API.
In this case use the followig line:

    luacwrap = import("luacwrap")

C modules which want to provide wrappers usually create their own namespace table to register their types. 
For an example see the source code of the `testluacwrap` module, which is provided with this package 
for unit testing.

### Registering type descriptors

Maybe the primary use case will be to register type descriptors from C but there is also a 
Lua API to reach this functionality.

#### Register array types

    type = luacwrap.registerarray(name, size, elemtype)
    
You can use `registerarray` to register a new array type.
Example:

    -- create type descriptor
    type_double128 = luacwrap.registerarray("double128", 128, "$dbl")
    -- create instance
    local myarray = type_double128:new()
    
#### Register/Create buffer types

    type = luacwrap.registerbuffer(name, size)

You can use `registerbuffer` to register a new buffer type.

Example:

    -- create type descriptor
    type_mybuf256 = luacwrap.registerbuffer("mybuf256", 256)
    -- create instance
    local mybuf = type_mybuf256:new()
    
To create buffers there is a dedicated `createbuffer` function
which combines the creation of the appropriate type descriptor
with the creation of a buffer instance via the `new` method.
The above code could be shrinked down to

    local mybuf = luacwrap.createbuffer(256)
    
The `createbuffer` function maintains an internal table indexed by 
the buffer size to create type descriptors only when needed.
    
#### Register record types

    type = luacwrap.registerstruct(name, size, members)

You can use `registerstruct` to register a new record type.
The parameter `members` is a table with entries for each struct member.
This entries have the form 

    { name, offset, type }
    
Usage:

    -- create type descriptor
    type_mystruct = luacwrap.registerstruct("mystruct", 8,
      {
        { "member1", 0, "$i32" },
        { "member2", 4, "$i32" }
      }
    )
    -- create struct instance
    local mystruct = type_mystruct:new()
    -- access members
    mystruct.member1 = 10
    mystruct.member2 = 22

<div class="attention">
Currently there is no check if a member declaration could address memory outside 
the struct size. 
</div>
    
### Create/Attach instances

Every registered type descriptor has two methods `new` and `attach` which could be used to
create new instances or create a wrapper around existing userdata.

    local struct = TESTSTRUCT:new()           -- create new garbage collected struct
    local wrap = TESTSTRUCT:attach(udata)     -- attach descriptor to (light) user data

### Initialize instance content

By default the `new` function initializes objects with 0. An aditional init parameter
changes this behaviour. If you specify a number as init parameter the object memory is 
filled with the given number value.
If you give a lua table the `new` function it assigns the name/value pairs to 
the corresponding attributes. This works recursively for embedded object instances. 

    local mystruct = struct = TESTSTRUCT:new{
      u8  = 91,
      i32 = 96,
      ptr = "hello",
      chararray = "hello",
      intarray = { 19,
             29,
             39,
             49,
      }
    }

An additional `set` function makes it possible to initialize existing object instances
from a given table of values.

    mystruct:set{
      u8  = 91,
      i32 = 96,
      ptr = "hello",
      chararray = "hello",
      intarray = { 19,
             29,
             39,
             49,
      }
    }

### Assign attribute values
    
Object attributes can be accessed like Lua table items.

    -- set
    mystruct.u32 = 100
    mystruct["u32"] = 100
    -- get
    local myval = mystruct.u32
    myval = mystruct["u32"]
    
### Duplicate objects

The `new` function could also be used to duplicate objects. If the first parameter is a 
object of the same type the contents of that object are used to initialize the newly created one.

    local mynewstruct = TESTSTRUCT:new(mystruct)

A shorter form is to use the `object:__dup()` function

    local mynewstruct = mystruct:__dup()

### Customizeable method table for struct and union types

You can easily extend struct and union types, that have been registered via luacwrap.
E.g. you have registered a rect structure under the name RECT, then you can add  
methods simply by adding them to the RECT type descriptor.

    function RECT:width()
      return self.right - self.left
    end

    function RECT:height()
        return self.bottom - self.top
    end

After that you can use these methods as follows:

    local rc = RECT:new()
    rc.set{ top=10; left=10; bottom=100; right=100 }
    print(rc:width(), rc:height())
 
## C-API

Since version 1.1.0-1 the C interface is exported it via a C interface struct.
This enables dependant C modules to load luacwrap dynamically via the Lua loader 
and avoids problems with module lookup (especially under Windows).

Typically during the module_open() function the dependant module gets access to the 
C interface struct with the following code:
    
    // luacwrap = require("luacwrap")
    lua_getglobal(L, "require");
    lua_pushstring(L, "luacwrap");
    lua_call(L, 1, 1);

    // get c interface
    lua_getfield(L, -1, LUACWARP_CINTERFACE_NAME);
    g_luacwrapiface = (luacwrap_cinterface*)lua_touserdata(L, -1);
    
    // check interface version
    if (LUACWARP_CINTERFACE_VERSION != g_luacwrapiface->version)
    {
      luaL_error(L, "Could not load luacwrap. Incompatiple C interface version. Expected %i got %i.", LUACWARP_CINTERFACE_VERSION, g_luacwrapiface->version);
    }
    
    // drop package table
    lua_pop(L, 1);

The resulting struct pointer (g_luacwrapiface) is then used in subsequent calls.

### Registering type descriptors

#### Register array types

    // describe array type
    LUACWRAP_DEFINEARRAY(LIBRARYNAME, INT32, 4)

    g_luacwrapiface->registertype(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, &regType_INT32_4.hdr);

#### Register record types

    // member descriptor for INNERSTRUCT
    static luacwrap_RecordMember s_memberINNERSTRUCT[] =
    {
      { "pszText",  offsetof(INNERSTRUCT, pszText),  "$ptr" },
      { NULL, 0 }
    };

    // type descriptor for INNERSTRUCT
    LUACWRAP_DEFINESTRUCT(LIBRARYNAME, INNERSTRUCT)

    // register type within globals table
    g_luacwrapiface->registertype(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, &regType_INNERSTRUCT.hdr);

#### Register buffer types

    luacwrap_BasicType regType_Buf32 =
    {
      LUACWRAP_TC_BUFFER,
      "$buf32",
      32
    };

    g_luacwrapiface->registerbasictype(L, &regType_Buf32);

#### Register basic types

For these types you have to specify appropriate get and set callbacks which handles
marshalling. Therefore registering basic types is only possible via the C API.
Use the `registerbasictype` function and see the source of LuaCwrap
for usage examples.

### Create wrappers for local C objects (light embedded objects)

From the C API in most cases you push wrapper objects (light embedded objects) to static 
instances to call functions with parameters. 

    // static instance
    TESTSTRUCT ud = { 0 };
    
    // fill struct with data
    ud.u8  =   8;
    ud.i8  =  -8;
    ...

    // call "myfunction" with wrapped object as parameter 1
    lua_getglobal(L, "myfunction");
    
    // push wrapper
    g_luacwrapiface->pushtypedptr(L, &regType_TESTSTRUCT.hdr, &ud);

    lua_call(L, 1, 0);

From Lua you use the instance as follows:

    function myfunction(teststruct)
      print(teststruct.u8)
    end

<div class="attention">
These wrappers are alive only during the function call.
It's definitely not a good idea to store them within the called function, e.g. in a global Lua variable or table. 
If you really have to, use the <code>object:__dup()</code> method to create a clone, which lifetime is controlled
by the Lua VM.
</div>

### Create boxed instances

Lifetime of boxed objects is maintained by the Lua garbage collector. To create them from the C API 
you use the pushboxedobj() function. 

    TESTSTRUCT* ud;
  
    // call "myfunction" with boxed object as parameter 1
    lua_getglobal(L, "myfunction");

    ud = (TESTSTRUCT*)g_luacwrapiface->pushboxedobj(L, &regType_TESTSTRUCT.hdr, 0);
    
    ud->u8  =   8;
    ud->i8  =  -8;
    ud->u16 =  16;
    ud->i16 = -16;
    ud->u32 =  32;
    ud->i32 = -32;
    ud->ptr =  "a ptr";
    
    lua_call(L, 1, 0);

From Lua you use the instance as follows:

    function myfunction(teststruct)
      print(teststruct.u8)
    end

### Attach to light userdata

With the `typedesc:attach()` function you can attach a light embedded object to an 
Lua userdata object which is interpreted as a pointer address. The above C sample could be modified 
like this:

    // static instance
    TESTSTRUCT ud = { 0 };
    
    // fill struct with data
    ud.u8  =   8;
    ud.i8  =  -8;
    ...

    // call "myfunction" with wrapped object as parameter 1
    lua_getglobal(L, "myfunction");
    
    // push wrapper
    lua_pushlightuserdata(L, &ud);

    lua_call(L, 1, 0);

From Lua you access the instance as follows:

    function myfunction(pointer)
      local teststruct = TESTSTRUCT:attach(pointer)
      print(teststruct.u8)
    end

<div class="attention">
Because LuaCwrap allows to attach wrappers to existing userdata (pointers) it is not safe 
according to the Lua book. Common errors will be detected by LuaCwrap, but as the <code>attach</code>
method acts like a C cast many things could go wrong. So if you use <code>attach</code> be sure 
you know what you are doing.
</div>

### Attach to embedded objects

Sometimes the final structure to attach to a given light userdata is not known in advance.
It is common practice in several APIs to hava a common header with a type or class field.
This field denotes the final structure to use.
Attaching could be done via the original light userdata which is also available as <object>.__ptr 
in embedded objects it is recomended to attach to the embedded object instance directly, 
because this also takes care of the lifetime of the embedded object instance.
Example:

    function myfunction(pointer)
      local teststruct = TESTSTRUCT:attach(pointer)
      -- attach another struct definition depending on 
      -- struct field
      if (2 == teststruct.class) then
        -- do not use pointer or teststruct.__ptr to attach to
        local extstruct = TESTSTRUCTEX:attach(teststruct)
        ...
      end
    end

###

# Internals

## Module table _M

LuaCwrap creates a single module table, where all module global data is stored.
The module table contains:

  * helper functions (e.g. tabletostring, getfield, setfield)
  * register functions (registerbuffer, registerarray, registerstruct)
  * buffer creation function (createbuffer)
  * reference release function (releasereference)
  * types table (_M.types)
  * reference table (_M.reftable)
  * string table (_M.stringtable)
  
## Type descriptor table _M.types

The type descriptor table spans the namespace for all registered types. Type names containing dots are
stored in the corresponding subtables.
The type table contains predefined types which names start with the '$' character. 
These are

  * $i8 , $u8  (signed/unsigned char)
  * $i16, $u16 (signed/unsigned short)
  * $i32, $u32 (signed/unsigned long)
  * $flt, $dbl (float, double)
  * $ptr       (pointer types)
  * $ref       (reference type utilizing the Lua reference mechanism)
  * $bufn      (buffer with length n, e.g. $buf128)

along with the platform dependant types

  * $int,  $uint  (signed/unsigned int)
  * $long, $ulong (signed/unsigned long)

Buffers are registered within the type table, too. The name of buffer types is derived
from the buffer length ($bufn, where n denotes the buffer length).
If a buffer with the requested size is already registered, the existing one is returned.

## Reference table _M.reftable

This table is used to control the lifetime of reference attributes ($ref).

## String table _M.stringtable

Used by the register function to store unique strings used within type descriptors.
